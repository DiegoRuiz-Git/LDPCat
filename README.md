# Code for *LDPC-cat codes for low-overhead quantum computing in 2D*

This repository presents the code used for the numerical simulations in the paper *LDPC-cat codes for low-overhead quantum computing in 2D*. The code is organized into four folders containing the code for Figure 1, Table II, Figure 5 and Figure S2 (which includes Figure 3).

Each folder includes a README.md file with more detailed information about the simulation performed for the corresponding figure.
